Hello! If you have came here for something amazing, sorry to disappoint. These are the files I'm writing that I will likely look back on, to learn [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/).

To run you will need [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) 1.8.1

Follow along simply by running each file with 'ppython' which comes with your [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) installation.
